                                                         **IJ-Cam**

IJ-Cam is a free and open source camera/ mirror app which is light weight and not as bulky as windows camera.
You can use IJ-Cam to check your camera before you join a major meeting for example or you can also use it as a mirror for makeup or whatever. There is a option to enable picture in picture and use it as a camera screen when you are sharing your screen

IJ-Cam is registered under the MIT lisence. It is open source and You are free to use it however you want.

You can also use this online at https://newtoallofthis123.github.io/IJ-Cam or https://kutt.it/IJ-Cam or https://tinu.be/IJ-Cam

To have a more stable, secure and good experince, please run the 

- first_run.bat on Windows
- first_run.sh  on macos and linux

This installs all the additional dependencies from node.js for electrom to run very smoothly.
You are free to tinker with the index.html as much as you want to change the ui.
The theme is Dark by deflaut, but if you want a light theme, replace the index.html with the index.html in the build_assets folder.

This is IJ-Cam 1.1.1 Hence there is no compiled executable you can run. 
Hence to start IJ-Cam, you can run the already included

- IJ-Cam.bat on windows
- IJ-Cam.sh  on linux

These basically call upon the electrom . to start the application.

Hence, you should have node.js and electron installed in order to run this application.
I have already included the latest node.js release for windows and 2 major linux distributions in the build_assets folder.

You can also download node.js for your distribution from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once you have installed node.js, you can run the electron_install.bat / electron_install.sh to install electron and you are all set to go

Now you can just launch the application using the above method

This will be fixed in 1.2.1
